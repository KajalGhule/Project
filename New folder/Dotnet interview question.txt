2. Request Delegate
->
 A Request Delegate is a function that handles an HTTP request in ASP.NET Core.
It represents a single step in the middleware pipeline and processes a n incoming request and produces a response.

public delegate Task RequestDelegate(HttpContext context);

Where is Request Delegate used?
It is used inside Middleware
Every middleware component receives a RequestDelegate called next
This next delegate points to the next middleware in the pipeline

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    // Before next middleware
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Before\n");

    await next(); // calls next RequestDelegate

    // After next middleware
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("After\n");
});

Why is Request Delegate important?
It allows ASP.NET Core to build a pipeline where each middleware:
Can process the request
Decide to pass it forward
Or stop the pipeline (short-circuit)

Request Delegate is a function that processes an HTTP request and represents a middleware component in the ASP.NET Core pipeline.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Difference Between Use and Run Method
-
Use()
Use() is used to add middleware that can pass the request to the next middleware in the pipeline.

Run()
Run() is used to terminate the request pipeline.
-----------------------------

What is Service Lifetime in ASP.NET Core?
Service lifetime defines how long a service instance lives in the Dependency Injection (DI) container.

ASP.NET Core provides three service lifetimes:
Transient
Scoped
Singleton


----------------------------------

Is it possible to run an ASP.NET Core application without middleware?
🔹 Short Answer (Interview Style):
No.
An ASP.NET Core application cannot process HTTP requests without middleware.


-------------------------------------

Default 5 Middleware in ASP.NET Core

app.UseExceptionHandler();
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();
